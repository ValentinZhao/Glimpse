# Glimpse
Android exercise application. Build for interviews.
<br>Much thanks to [Look Look](https://github.com/xinghongfei/LookLook). I basically understand the MVP through it.</br>
<br>Junior year at my univ and hope this app could be accomplished properly.</br>
## Features
**Glimpse** has integreated Zhihu and Bilibili Api now, and it could provide you many funny articles about science, relationship, hot news and so on. In Bilibili section it could also present you with trends in every topic- probably the one you are interested!
## Timeline
- 2/14/2017 <br>Zhihu section accomplished! And happy Valentine's day you guys although many of you probably don't have one.
- 2/15/2017 <br>Preparing for importing Dribbble API to build next section.
- 2/19/2017 <br>Terminate the Dribbble api importing. Preparing for importing Bilibili api.</br>
- 3/2/2017 <br>Bilibili section accomplished! In fact I could have fixed this section a week ago, however, I met with some algorithm problems and took a few days to solve and collect them.
